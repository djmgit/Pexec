# PExec

PExec is a lightweight CLI based tool and libray for executing commands on remote servers. It allows you to execute
commands on a list of remote hosts both sequentially - one after the other, parallely - execute the command on all the
hosts simultaneously all at once to speed up the process and lastly to group the list of servers into batches and execute
the command on the servers present in those individual batches in parallel.
